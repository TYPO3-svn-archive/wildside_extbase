DO NOT INSTALL ON TYPO3 < 4.5rcX !!!

This extension currently relies on a TYPO3 source patch, as tested on TYPO3 4.5rc2

You will need to apply the source patch in order to get this working. The source patch 
has been requested as a new core TYPO3 feature @ http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=17345 - 
you should check the status on this link before you start applying any patches. If a 
minor update to your TYPO3 source is all that is required (and I'm hoping it will be, soon) 
then surely this is much better than messing around with patches.

TO INSTALL:

either add this to your localconf.php:
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['MAIL']['transport'] = 'Tx_WildsideAmazonSes_MailInvoker';

or use the install tool to configure the MAIL -> transport parameter, set value to:
Tx_WildsideAmazonSes_MailInvoker

You've been warned :)
