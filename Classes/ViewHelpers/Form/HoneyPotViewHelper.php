	/**
	 * Render a spamprotection honeypot field. The field will be hidden and contain
	 * no text - it will be named with a variation of the name "email" which should
	 * fool any spam robot into filling out the field. A hook is registered which checks 
	 * a stored session variable against every form submit (method=POST); if a 
	 * capture has been detected various log events are added and the session is, 
	 * optionally, shut down completely to prevent any further traffic.
	 * 
	 * You may configure the HoneyPot to display a special page to the user if caught.
	 * 
	 * All notifications to RIPE are recorded in the syslog of TYPO3 and checks are performed
	 * to always avoid repeating abuse reports as long as the syslog has retention.
	 * 
	 * This ViewHelper uses the AbuseAssistant singleton - you can use this yourself
	 * to record what you consider abuse and perform the exact same actions this ViewHelper 
	 * performs, as configured. Just a quick thought, this can be used to limit the amount
	 * of times a user is allowed to perform quarantining, for example of users posting 
	 * too many comments or even using bad language in a comment...
	 * 
	 * See Classes/Security/AbuseAssistant for more information.
	 * 
	 * @param string $id Unique ID string of this particular HoneyPot instance. Can be shared between forms - but would in this case make all forms employing the HoneyPot susceptible to the same abuse/quarantine checks and all calls to the viewhelper overrides previous settings
	 * @param string $name Optional name of the input field generated
	 * @param int $abuseTolerance Number of times a client is allowed to "abuse" the form before being reported
	 * @param int $abusePage UID of page to display when abuse is detected
	 * @param boolean $quarantine If TRUE, client is quarantined after having abused > $abuseTolerance
	 * @param boolean $quarantineIpAddress If TRUE, quarantine is determined by IP address (default=FALSE)
	 * @param boolean $quarantineSession If TRUE, quarantine is limited to session duration (default=FALSE)
	 * @param boolean $quarantinePage If set, displays this page to a qurantined client/ip. If $abusePage is set but $quarantinePage is not, $abusePage is used
	 * @param int $quarantineDuration Number of seconds to quarantine client. Default is 24 hours.
	 * @param boolean $blackHole If TRUE, abusers are sent to a black hole of infinite wait/redirect/wait requests to (hopefully) block the spam bot (default=FALSE)
	 * @param boolean $syslog If TRUE, abuse is logged to TYPO3 syslog (default=TRUE)
	 * @return string
