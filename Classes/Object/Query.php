/**
 * Query for an Object - applies logic from data storage Query to any type of 
 * ObjectStorage, object or array. Filter a list of objects or a single object 
 * by creating a Query, setting original and applying constraints as you normally 
 * would to a Repository query. As a matter of fact, this class is to 
 * Tx_Extbase_Persistence_ObjectStorage, objects and arrays exactly what   
 * Tx_Extbase_Persistence_Query is to Tx_Extbase_Peristence_Repository. Enjoy.
 * 
 * This is particularly useful for a well-known, SQL-syntactical QueryObjectModel 
 * for data gotten NOT from SQL but for example posted via a plugin, read as JSON 
 * or simply gotten from a text file if you only need to perform VERY simple 
 * storage but still need to be able to filter it after reading it.
 * 
 * Note: QueryResult is also supported and returns a new QueryResult. However,
 * for QueryResult filtering you are more likely to get better performance out 
 * of performing this filtering in your Repository class (and if necessary for dynamic
 * filtering options, create your own findBy**** methods and allow additional
 * arguments defining the search).
