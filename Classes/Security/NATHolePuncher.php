/**
 * DISCLAIMER:
 * 
 * PLEASE RESPECT YOU USERS! - do not abuse this feature! Its ONLY intended use
 * is for UDP-P2P-type applications or support for specialized client-applications
 * which need your TYPO3-webapplication to "talk back" directly to the user without
 * employing interval-based HTTP requests but with the need to support usage 
 * behind restrictive (corporate usually) firewalls. Yeah, I know. Special case.
 * 
 * This fairly simple class is capable of punching through a NAT on the 
 * client side, through any security layer which is configured to still
 * allow sending of UDP packets. Which would be any system, pretty much.
 * 
 * Blends very well with advanced Flash/Silverlight/JavaApplet applications, 
 * especially direct P2P-communication purposes.
 * 
 * The endpoints can be any two IPs - but the contact HAS to be initiated by
 * both endpoints at approximately the same time (given TTL for an UDP packet
 * state in the firewall). You can use the server as endpoint #2; this causes
 * an UDP packet to be sent from the server to the client and vice versa, 
 * opening a transparent UDP connection to your client on the port you 
 * specify.
 * 
 * Keep in mind that the port must be clear and probably should be randomized 
 * and kept above 1024.
 * 
 * I take absolutely no responsibility for how you use this. All methods 
 * used are immediately available and do not break any laws at all. Traffic 
 * on the port, however, is of course subject to all relevant laws.
 * 
 * This also works when called as static, i.e. 
 * Tx_WildsideExtbase_Security_NATHolePuncher::punchHole(12345, $c1, $c2);
