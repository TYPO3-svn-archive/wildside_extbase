/**
 * DISCLAIMER:
 * 
 * 
 * Now for the "I told you so"-prevention part:
 * 
 * There's a fairly high probability your users will NOT appreciate 
 * you using this class. It thoroughly exploits browser behaviour
 * and leaves the visitor without any control over the cookie. Please
 * only use this where you absolute must have a permanent cookie solution.
 * 
 * Don't use it to track your visitors... respect privacy. Don't be a 
 * douche. Always allow your users to remove the EverCookie.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * It employs a limited subset of the features used by the "evercookie"
 * proof-of-concept created by Samy Kamkar, Poland, to create an almost
 * indestructible and permanent cookie on the users' computer.
 * 
 * There are some major issues connected to using this. You were warned.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * CAVEATS AND WARNINGS:0
 * 
 * 1) Keep in mind that for the cookies to actually "become" EverCookies, 
 * at least one succesful FE rendering is required AFTER setting the 
 * cookie.
 * 
 * 2) Also keep in mind that the only sure way to delete an EverCookie 
 * is through the "evercookie" library or this EverCookieManager class.
 * 
 * 3) DO NOT register sensitive data! The initial cookie value is transported
 * as clear-text. Hence, NEVER EVER (I -really- mean this) USE THIS ON
 * ANY PAGE WHICH GETS CACHED!
 * 
 * 4) Cookies permeate between browsers supporting the Shared Local Object
 * procedures -unless- LSO data is removed (well, at least until the 
 * user visits a page that re-permeates the EverCookie all over).
 * 
 * 5) It is NOT possible to specify a TTL for this cookie! If MUST be removed
 * manually!
 * 
 * 6) The SecuritySession class uses this method if setEverCookie(TRUE) is used.
 * As a precaution against immediate abuse, the SecuritySession informs the 
 * user's browser that it is in fact being given a cookie which is not likely
 * to vanish any time soon. Additionally, it adds page header data (meta, not
 * visible) informing the visitor of the EverCookie usage.
